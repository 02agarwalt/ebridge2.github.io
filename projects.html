                    <p>Processing MRI graphs has exploded into the forefront of modern neuroscience. With this sudden burst, many new problems arise for modern nueroscience researchers, namely, how to have their brain scans processed optimally. Using our discriminability analysis results (see below), we propose an optimal fMRI processing pipeline, and are developing a full scale pipeline to complement our existing DTI processing pipeline for fMRI scans. Our pipeline will be installable through pip, and will allow users to easily process their scans locally for either fMRI or DTI datasets to produce robust graphs. Additionally, we will extend our fMRI pipeline to be deployable on our Neurodata architecture, so that any neuroscietists can simply upload their scans and have their graphs sent to them. Moreover, we will build visualization tools to enable high resolution examination of the results, along with a comprehensive quality control suite to ensure the accuracy of our computations.</p>

                    <p>Along with our fMRI processing pipeline, we are seeking to understand the complex neural mechanism behind working memory, and how different types of tasks impact the activation of regions of interest. Unfortunately I can't say too much on the topic yet as we are in the early stages of our analysis, however, I can say that we have some super exciting results so far, and will come out with some awesome discoveries over the next year! Once we finish our analyses here, we will extend our methods to our fMRI portion of the NDMG pipeline and provide a robust way for researchers to perform task based analysis.</p>

                    <p>When looking at the relationship between weighted networks and traditional small world measures, my colleagues and I found that existing measure were seriously lacking. We found that, not only were existing measures highly dependent upon nuisance values such as density, but they also failed to take into consideration a very key feature of network performance, connection strength. For example, two networks with the same nodes connected, one with connections of varying (weighted) strengths and the other with equivalent (binarized) strengths, would be assessed the exact same Small World Coefficient.</p>

                    <p>To rectify this issue, we introduce the small world coefficient in our paper, <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep22057">Small-World Propensity in Weighted, Real-World Networks</a>. The small world propensity provides a robust statistic for assessing small-world structure in networks of varying densities. We find that, compared to higher level organisms such as humans, the C. Elegans network demonstrates remarkably low Small-World Propensity, a significant observation as the C. Elegans represents the canonical biological example of a small-world network. </p>

                    <p>In the past 20 years, applying computational statistics to the brain has become an intriguing problem for researchers. One of the most popular of these methods involves ROI timeseries analysis of fMRI data. To conduct ROI timeseries analysis, researchers essentially map regions of the brain to an atlas of arbitrary size; regions may be determined by performance, or other features like activity correlations over a massive dataset. The regions essentially "map" every volume-pixel, or voxel, of the brain to a point on the map. Then, we take some other dataset and figure out which voxels in our new scans lie within each different region specified in each region, and form a vector for each voxel of the intensity with respect to the timecourse. We then average the activity levels for all voxels contained in each region of interest, and are left with a "timeseries" for each roi.</p>
                    <p>If that sounds pretty complicated, you are not alone in your thoughts. Each step along the way from brain graph to timeseries has many options and parameters that are researcher defined, and the common academic is left puzzled with which to chose for a given study. As a part of the mrimages to graphs, our team is looking into some of the most common timeseries extraction methods, and comparing their performance. To compare performance, we are seeking to find the measures that show the most robustness across scans for single subject. Stated another way, we are looking to find which measures will allow researchers to extract timeseries that are reliable for a single subject, and particularly, will be repeatable whenever analysis is conducted for that same subject following a future fMRI scan. We have introduced numerous new statistics and measures, in addition to proposing a standardized, optimal processing pipeline to ensure repeatability of fMRI analysis.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever been exploring a city, and been curious as to your safety? Stroll safe compiles all of the latest crime data for a given area, and uses a custom algorithm for determining the crime intensity of a given area (a combination of crime frequency and crime severity). This outputs the users with a heat map of the area, and provides them with push notifications if they walk into a  dangerous area. By simply pressing the "I feel unsafe" button at the bottom, a user can easily dial 911, an emergency contact, or call a taxi. Our project won the Everyblock API award, and we are currently working on improving the project for a potential startup.
